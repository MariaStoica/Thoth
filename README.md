# Thoth

A reading list generator

Input: an xml file with your ranked books in each category

Output: a txt file with the book titles in the proposed reading order

Run: `python thot.py nameOfStartingCategory`

My reading list rules:

* every 3rd book has to be a fiction book
* every 4th book has to be a technical book
* randomize the rest between self development and interesting topics


If any small thing can be automated, do it. You never know when a few previously busy seconds of thinking will be beneficial.
